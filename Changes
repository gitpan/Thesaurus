(several years later)

Just for kicks, I thought I'd rework this code a bit, given that this
is the first CPAN module I ever wrote and could use some rewriting.
This release does break a fair chunk of the old interface, but I think
that's for the best.

- Remove Thesaurus::DBI (which never did anything anyway, it was just
placeholder code that never got written).

- Remove Thesaurus::DBM in favor of new Thesaurus::BerkeleyDB module.

- Remove Thesaurus::File in favor of new Thesaurus::CSV module.

- Rewrite internals quite a bit.

- Change "dump" method to "all".
