This is the Thesaurus module and its subclasses.

Currently, this is alpha code.  However, all the basic functionality
for the Thesaurus, Thesaurus::File, and Thesaurus::DBM (except for
locking) is in place.  Thesaurus::DBI is currently an empty module
with some docs.  The interface is unlikely to change in any major way.

Thesaurus is a module that implements the notion of equivalence
between things (anything that fits in a scalar).


To Do

- Thesarus::DBI.  This means making Thesaurus::DBI::<your DB system
here> subclasses as well as a configuration script to help people set
up the tables they'll need to implement this.  My goal is to make this
very flexible so there are no hardcoded column or table names.  I plan
to implement MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL subclasses (probably in
that order).

- test.pl (coming with the next verison, I swear).

- Locking in Thesaurus::DBM.
